# Machine-Leaning-Project
In this project, I played a key role in a project focused on data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model selection. The project involved comparing the results of three different machine learning models, as well as a NULL model that predicted by calculating the average. My responsibilities included examining the data to ensure that the assumptions of each model were met and performing feature engineering to achieve better results in the prediction.

During the project, I carefully selected input features for the model and justified my choices by conducting thorough exploratory data analysis. This involved handling outliers, identifying variables that were correlated, and making a feature selection to achieve a better result.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the models, I developed several error metrics and plotted the results where appropriate. I then critically analyzed the results of the modeling to determine which model was the most effective for predicting outcomes.

Overall, my contributions to this project resulted in a more accurate and efficient prediction model, which was used to drive data-informed decision making.
