Data preparation. Exploratory data analysis(EDA) with ML Model
Choose three different models and compare the results. Also create a NULL model that predicts by 
calculating the average as shown in the lesson.
• There are different assumptions that apply to the different models. Are these assumptions met? 
Examine the data carefully. Can this justify how well or poorly the models work on predicting? You can 
do feature engineering, ie change the data, to achieve better results in the prediction.
• Select input features for the model and justify why. Here you should add more powder to the 
exploratory data analysis part. For example, are there outliers that need to be handled? Are the 
variables correlated? Make feature selection and see if you can achieve a better result.
• Results of the prediction analysis. Develop several error metrics, plot results if appropriate for the 
model. Critically analyze the results of the modeling.
